    "The objective of this breakout session is to experiment with using the (normalized) Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filter to detect the scale of \"blobs\" in images.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to define the LoG filter function `get_LoG_filter(kernel_size, sigma)`, apply it at multiple scales and show that the peak of the filter response occurs at the $\\sigma$ we expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement the (normalized) LoG filter function using [this resource](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/log.htm).\n",
    "2. Visualize a few filtered circle images (to confirm it works as expected) after applying the LoG filter. You should see a change as a function of $\\sigma$.\n",
    "3. Compute the maximum response as a function of $\\sigma$ and plot the results (for each sigma, apply the filter and compute the maximum response [positive and negative] via `np.abs(filtered_image).max()`). Does the maximum occur where you expect? How does this compare to the location of the maximal response for the unnormalized LoG filter."
