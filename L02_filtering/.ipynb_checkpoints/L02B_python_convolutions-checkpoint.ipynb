    "\n",
    "As a simple exercise to familiarize ourselves with numpy and scipy, we will be taking a look at a few different implementations of the Convolution in 1D and implement a couple of simple filters to experiment with.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I have provided you with two example 1D convolution functions—one using Numpy and one using the built-in Scipy function—that perform the same operation. Run the code below and try to understand what it's doing. It generates a simple \"identity kernel\" and applies it (via a convolution) to a noisy example signal.\n",
    "2. Write the function `get_box_filter`, which should return a kernel . How does the filtered signal change as the width increases. You may find it helpful to know that `np.ones((N))` returns a 1D array of 1's of length N.\n",
    "3. Write the function `get_gaussian_filter`. Element of the filter is proportional to $\\exp(-d^2/(2 \\sigma^2))$, where $d$ is the distance (in pixels) from the center of the filter. The function `np.exp` implements the exponential function, and will be helpful here. If you're not as familiar with it, the Gaussian filter comes up in a number of applications in Physics, mathematics, and probability (as the [Bell Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution))."
