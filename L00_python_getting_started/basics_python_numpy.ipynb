The primary difference between them is that lists are mutable (and can be modified), while tuples are not (and cannot). There are a number of convenience operations for working with both. Some basic principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Getting an element of lists and tuples is done via square brackets (and indexing starts at zero).\n",
    "- Negative indices can be used to index *backwards* into the array, so that `some_list[-1]` will return the last element of that list.\n",
    "- `len(some_list)` will return the length of a list\n",
    "- Python lists and tuples support *slicing*, which allows you to get multiple list elements. `data[2:4]`, will return another list with elements `data[2]` and `data[3]` (Note that the slice is inclusive on the lower end and not inclusive on the upper end.) One can also use `data[2:]` to get all elements 2-and-up and `data[:5]` to get all elements up to (though not including) 5. Finally, `data[::2]` will return every 2nd element of `data`.\n",
